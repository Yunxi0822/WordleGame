How to run the code and play the game?
Rule of the game:
An English word consisting of five letters is selected at random (by the computer) 
from a list of words, but kept hidden from the human player. The player tries to guess 
the 5-letter word. The player is allowed to make 6 guesses in total to discover the 
target word. The player is given feedback after each attempt they make. The 
feedback is as follows; 
There are three colors that the cells containing the letters can be: green, yellow, or 
grey. 
1. Green means the letter is contained in the word and is in that position. 
2. Yellow means the letter is contained in the word but not in that position. 
3. Grey means the letter is not contained in the word.

 
How to run and play:
Firstly, download the code and import the MiniPro project.
Compile and run, and then you can see the game page.
Type on the keyboard to input letters. If you type an wrong letter, type Backspace to undo.
 Remember to switch to English and enter lowercase letters. Capital letters are invalid

After you finish one term of game(win or not),there will be a page asking you whether or not to play again. If you click YES, the game restarts. If you click the NO button, the program will exit


Hint: You have a better chance of guessing the answer by choosing crane as the first word！！
